<h1>This is my submission for Homework 1</h1>
<p>Recently, I have read and heard about the <em>importance</em> of learning web development as a programmer. In my own study, it seems very intimidating, as there are so many sources to reference. Through this course, I hope to learn applicable use of <strong>html, CSS, and JavaScript.</strong></p>

<button onclick = "buttonPress()"> Button </button>

<script>
    function buttonPress() {
        alert('The button was pressed... like some orange juice!')
    }
</script>
